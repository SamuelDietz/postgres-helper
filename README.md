# postgres-helper

The all-in-one postgres module for SQL enjoyers.

## Features

This module acts as a convenient wrapper around the [postgres](https://github.com/porsager/postgres), [ley](https://github.com/lukeed/ley) and [kanel](https://github.com/kristiandupont/kanel) packages, providing a seamless integration of their functionalities:

- Simplified SQL query execution using ES6 Tagged Template Strings with enforced safety
- Migration solution built on top of the Tagged Template Strings
- (Optional) automatic type generation after migrations

## Installation

```bash
npm install postgres-helper
```

## Thanks

To all the original authors of the packages whose code I stole to create this one.
